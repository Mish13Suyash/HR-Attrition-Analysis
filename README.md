# HR-Attrition-Analysis

Using data science, hiring and retaining top talent is an extremely challenging task that requires capital, time, and skills. Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income, such as hiring, for example. Companies spend 15% to 20% of the employees' salary to recruit a new candidate, which is a massive amount, especially for large corporations with thousands of employees.

By developing accurate prediction models that could predict employee retention, you could potentially save the company hundreds of thousands of dollars.
